                    <p>A React and Redux data dashboard prototype built with d3.js visualizations. The project was my first use of Redux with React. It was designed as to be a proof of concept for a 
                        more robust and nimble TV ratings data management tool and reporting platform. I developed an accomanying MySQL database and API using the PHP Slim API framework.
                        The project was especially challenging given the small numbers associated with TV ratings (expressed in decimals, ie: 0.16). Ratings required duration weighting and other
                        complex calculations in order to match other existing data reports that are created manually. 
                          The data has been randomized and all labels and key identifiers are obfiscated.</p>
